## MiniMaple

Write the symbolic diff function

Example:
```
4*x^3, x //=> 12*x^2
4*x^3, y // =>
4*x^3-x^2, x //=> 12*x^2 - 2*x 
```
Allowed operations are +, - and *

Any other operation should lead to an error.

Use TDD!

## UI

Implement minimalistic UI: input field, resulting text and a button to run it.
